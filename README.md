# Portfolio Managment

This is a simple personal project.
I am developing this to help me understand the working of the financial world and the role of technologies in it.

This is developed in Golang with backend written in flask.

## Routes

- `/books/{title}/page/{page}` For testing out router mux in golang
- `/todo` Testing template functionality in golang
- `/` Trying out dynamic content in the template functionality
- `/stocks` List out the list of stocks to choose for a Portfolio
- `/contactus` A simple contact us form I tested for POST request capability
- `/portfolioStats` Final url one is directed with Portfolio Stats

## Backend

This application servers just the frontend. Here is the [link](https://github.com/aniarya82/portfolioAPI.git) for the backend server written in python.

## Prerequisites

go get github.com/gorilla/mux
